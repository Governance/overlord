Getting Started
---------------


1. Deploy
~~~~~~~~~

Option 1. Deploy to JBossEAP. First you need to navigate to 
http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads then login and download 
EAP 6.1.1 Final (jboss-eap-6.1.1.zip) to this directory.

then

....
ant deploy
....

When ready, start EAP in standalone mode (jboss-eap-6.1/bin/standalone.sh) using a different shell

Option 2. Deploy to Tomcat

....
ant deploy-tomcat
....

When ready, start Tomcat (apache-tomcat-<version>/bin/startup.sh). 

2. When all the applications
are booted up, open your browser and navigate to.

http://localhost:8080/s-ramp-ui

when successful you can move onto step 3.

3. Seed
~~~~~~~

You can now add the following section to your .m2/settings.xml
....
<server>
   <id>local-sramp-repo-snapshots</id>
   <username>admin</username>
   <password>your-admin-password</password>
</server>
<server>
   <id>local-sramp-repo-snapshots</id>
   <username>admin</username>
   <password>your-admin-password</password>
</server>
....
Insert the admin password you supplied during step 1.

Make sure the applications are fully booted up before you start the seeding
....
ant seed
....
This will upload the ontologies as well as the workflows. You can verify
success using the s-ramp-ui. Demos for both S-RAMP and DTGov are available in 
their respective distribution directories.

Good luck!
